# Project Title: LibraTrack: Library Management System  

Responsive Bootstrap 5 layouts for Homepage, Registration, Login, and Forgot Password  

LibraTrack is a PHP-based platform designed to help schools manage library operations efficiently. It replaces manual record-keeping with a digital system, reducing errors and saving time for librarians and students. The system lets librarians add, edit, and organize books; register student members; and track borrowing and returns while monitoring low-stock and overdue items. It includes quick book searches by title, author, or category, plus simple email alerts for overdue or low-stock books. This system is intended for librarians and students who need a secure, organized, and easy-to-use library tool.
