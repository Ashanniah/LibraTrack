Project Title: 
LibraTrack:Library Management System

Responsive Bootstrap 5 layouts for Homepage, Registration, Login, and Forgot Password

LibraTrack is a PHP-based platform designed to help schools manage library 
operations efficiently. It replaces manual record-keeping with a digital system, reducing errors 
and saving time for librarians and students. The system lets librarians add, edit, and organize 
books; register student members; and track borrowing and returns while monitoring low-stock 
and overdue items. It includes quick book searches by title, author, or category, plus simple email 
alerts for overdue or low-stock books. This system is intended for librarians and students who 
need a secure, organized, and easy-to-use library tool.# library-management-system
